# Chat Application in Golang and React

Simple chat application done in Golang and React.

# My motivation to build this project

Recenty I started to explore new programming language - Golang. I haven't build any chat app before, so it was good idea to build something like that. <br>
For frontend I chose React. <br>
Majority of my focus were placed in experimenting with WebSockets and handling auth with JWT.

# Try it!

App is available [here](https://chatappgolang.dominikkoniarz.pl/).
